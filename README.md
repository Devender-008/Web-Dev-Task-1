# Responsive Company Team Page

This project is part of my internship at *VeriTech IT Software Solutions, where I was tasked with developing a responsive "Company Member Team Page". The project is implemented using **HTML* and *CSS* to ensure a clean and professional web page layout that is optimized for various devices, such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design and implement a web page showcasing the company's team members, categorized into:
- Leadership / Management Team
- Development Team
- Sales & Marketing Team
